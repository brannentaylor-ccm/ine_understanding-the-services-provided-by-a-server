### [Secure RESTful APIs using Python](https://my.ine.com/course/secure-restful-apis-using-python/2f85f9e2-2dc8-4a87-8ee3-57dea3eb9b9d)

# Understanding the services provided by a server

In order to complete this project, you should launch the provided server by running the following at a separate terminal on your local system:

```bash
FLASK_APP=project.py flask run --port 5009
```

The port 5009 is not used by any well-known service or protocol, so it is unlikely it will be in use on your system. However, in case it is, you may change the port you launch on and the corresponding projects to find an unused port.  Launching the Flask server will fail if the port has been claimed, and you can try as many others as you like (the entire 5000-5500 range should mostly be available).


Start with the Notebook `Project.ipynb`, and best of luck!
