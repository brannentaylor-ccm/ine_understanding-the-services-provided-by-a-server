Launching the Flask server will fail if the port has been claimed, and you can try as many others as you like (the entire 5000-5500 range should mostly be available).\n",

When there is a problem, the service will indicate \"503 Service Unavailable\" to show that it has fallen behind.  When the server succeeds, what it responds will be identical to the `/NASA` route.\n",
    "\n",
    "You wish to utilize this service, but not so heavily that it will fail.  Therefore, you'd like to avoid making requests overly frequently; however, determining how frequently is **too** frequently is the purpose of this task.  Again, avoid looking at the code for the running service, stipulating that it is actually running on a machine you do not control.\n",
    "\n",
    "Keep in mind that just because two specific requests succeed after a certain wait, that doesn't mean that the same wait will *always* be sufficient.  In a real-life server, you are never really guaranteed this; on this toy sample, a sufficiently long wait will allow requests always to succeed.  In this task, you simply want to wait long enough that failures are *very unlikely* (you can determine what constitutes \"very\" to your own satisfaction. \n",
    "\n",
    "Politeness to the external service is certainly a concern.  Flooding the service with requests in the hopes they will succeed eventually is bad manners (and counter-productive for a burdened server)."
